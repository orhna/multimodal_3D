# multimodal_3D
Exploring Unsupervised Multimodal 3D Understanding, a project for Advanced Topics in 3D CV Praktikum

## Start
Follow the steps under the [installation](../installation.md) first. 

## Download data for the birds experiment:
[download](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1DkFI6CFrMVSiFE5o7pssg-AHPXctCS_j?usp=sharing)

## Experiments
Either run the experiments on the [notebook](notebooks/highlight_evaluate_birds.ipynb) or with the [script](experiments_bird.py)


## Optional
[augmentation](notebooks/aug_projection.ipynb) with trial&error

## Simplified distillation pipeline
[notebook](notebooks/distill_simplified.ipynb)* to distill a network from scratch
## Simplified pipeline to save distilled 3D features
[notebook](notebooks/eval_simplified.ipynb)* to get the distilled features with a pre-trained model

*need to be launched under original openscene repo
